<br><br>

## 🚀 Sprint 3 – Hypotheses Structuring and Solution Definition  
<br>
Sprint 3
During Sprint 3, we moved on to the phase of defining and consolidating the entrepreneurial project proposal. The focus was on formulating concrete hypotheses regarding the solution's viability, evaluating technologies and sustainable strategies.

## 🛠️ Main Deliverables:  
<br>

- 📝 **Initial Scope Registration of the Entrepreneurial Project**  
Structuring the concept of the practical project and defining the foundations for its development.  
<br>

- 💡 **Formulation of Hypotheses about the Product or Service**  
Development of hypotheses on how the solution could be differentiated and innovative within the context of sustainable fashion.  
<br>

- 🧵 **Selection of the Priority Hypothesis**  
After a comparative analysis, **Hypothesis 3.3 – Craftsmanship Assisted by Software and Modeling Processes** was chosen as the main proposal for the MVP.  
The solution aims to create a system capable of adapting sizes according to body measurements.  
<br>

- 📢 **User Profile Mapping (Postponed to Module 2)**  
Although initiated, in agreement with the advisor, the user/consumer profile mapping was postponed for further development in the next module.  

This strategic decision was made to ensure that the solution definition was properly consolidated before collecting qualitative data.  
Starting the user mapping prematurely could generate inconsistencies, given that the project was still in the conceptual consolidation phase.  
Thus, it was decided to defer this step to ensure that the user profile research would be more precise and aligned with the proposed product.  
<br>

## 🎯 Sprint Objective:  
<br>
Define the concept of the entrepreneurial project, consolidate the solution hypothesis, and establish a structured foundation for the MVP development, aligning innovation, sustainability, and technological viability.

<br>
Sprint 4
During Sprint 4, the focus was on deepening the conceptual and practical foundation of the project, aiming to refine insights and structure the first screens and functionalities of the proposed solution.

📢 Although the initial plan involved evaluating sustainable models and environmental impacts, the sprint evolved into a more applied and exploratory path.

This strategic shift occurred because, together with the academic advisor, I identified the need to prioritize practical experimentation and the initial structuring of the proposed solution. It was considered essential to:

Explore empirical knowledge related to manual techniques, strengthening the practical foundation of the MVP;

Test and develop basic artisanal skills, such as crochet, to better understand the challenges and particularities of manual work;

Investigate the technical differentials of software like CLO 3D and Knitting Genius, identifying gaps and opportunities for the technological proposal;

Structure the initial wireframes, visually anticipating the flow and user experience of the solution to be developed.

Thus, evolving into a more practical and exploratory approach was crucial to consolidate practical foundations, align project expectations, and ensure that the proposed solution would be viable, innovative, and effectively aligned with sector demands.

<br>
🛠️ Main Deliverables:
<br>

- 🧠 **Theoretical Exploration on Empirical Knowledge**  
Study on manual practices and the importance of tacit knowledge in developing sustainable and inclusive solutions.  
<br>
