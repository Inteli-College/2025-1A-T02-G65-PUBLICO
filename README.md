<br>

### 🎯 Sprint Objective:

<br>

Support the project with strategic information and critical analysis, strengthening the theoretical and market foundation for building innovative and sustainable solutions in future modules.

<br>

## **Sprint 3**

During **Sprint 3**, we moved forward to the phase of defining and consolidating the entrepreneurial project proposal. The focus was on formulating concrete hypotheses about the solution's viability, evaluating technologies and sustainable strategies.

Additionally, analyses were carried out to determine which path would make the most sense for the project, leading to the selection of the priority hypothesis.

<br>

### 🛠️ Main Deliverables:

<br>

- 📝 **Initial Scope Record of the Entrepreneurial Project**  
  Structuring the concept of the practical project and defining the foundation for its development.

<br>

- 💡 **Structuring Hypotheses about the Product or Service**  
  Formulating hypotheses on how the solution could be differentiated and innovative within the sustainable fashion context.

<br>

- 🧵 **Selection of the Priority Hypothesis**  
  After comparative analysis, **Hypothesis 3.3 - Craftsmanship Assisted by Software and Modeling Processes** was selected as the main proposal for the MVP.  
  The solution aims to develop a system capable of adapting sizes according to body measurements.

<br>

- 📢 **User Profile Mapping (Postponed to Module 2)**  
  Although initiated, the mapping of the sustainable user/consumer profile was rescheduled for deeper exploration in the next module.  
  The focus in this sprint remained on defining the project's core idea.

<br>

### 🎯 Sprint Objective:

<br>

Define the concept of the entrepreneurial project, consolidate the solution hypothesis, and establish a structured foundation for MVP development, aligning innovation, sustainability, and technological feasibility.
