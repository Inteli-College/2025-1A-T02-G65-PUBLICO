📚 Module 1 – Fashion and Sustainability
The first module of the project aimed to conduct an in-depth mapping of the challenges, opportunities, and trends in the sustainable fashion sector, with the objective of building a solid foundation for the development of the next phases of the project.

In this module, an exploratory and investigative approach was adopted, structured around three main axes: research, analysis, and practice.

<br>
Sprint 1
<br>
During Sprint 1, the goal was to investigate the main challenges of sustainable fashion and contextualize the problem within the sector.

<br>
🌎 Mapping of opportunities
Analysis of a successful case in sustainable fashion, identifying best practices and potential paths for innovation.

<br>
💡 Initial reflection on possible solutions
Development of initial ideas for innovative approaches based on the analysis of mapped challenges and trends.

<br>
📝 Planning documentation
Completion of the project plan, meeting forms, and tracking forms, formalizing the record of activities.

<br>
🎯 Sprint Objective:
<br>
Build the initial conceptual and strategic foundation of the project, providing input for the next stages of deepening and solution development.

<br>
Sprint 2
<br>
During Sprint 2, the objective was to gather quantitative and qualitative data to support the project, analyzing trends, impacts, and existing business models.

Additionally, this sprint was also dedicated to reflecting on personal goals for the project and areas of greatest interest, guiding strategic choices for the next phases.

<br>
🛠️ Main Deliverables:
<br>
📊 Market research on sustainable fashion
Collection of quantitative and qualitative data, trend analysis, and identification of gaps in the sector.

<br>
🌱 Analysis of the environmental and social impact of the fashion industry
Mapping of the most critical areas and the main negative impacts throughout the fashion production cycle.

<br>
🎯 Identification of strategies to make initial ideas viable
Reflection on strategic approaches to make sustainable fashion more applicable and realistic in the current market context.

<br>
📖 Complementary literature review
Continuation of theoretical research with new scientific articles, academic studies, and updated industry reports.

<br>
🧩 Update of the glossary of key terms
Expansion and refinement of the glossary by incorporating new relevant concepts for the project.

<br>
🎯 Sprint Objective:
<br>
Support the project with strategic information and critical analysis, strengthening the theoretical and market foundation for building innovative and sustainable solutions in the next modules.

<br>
Sprint 3
<br>

During Sprint 3, we moved on to the phase of defining and consolidating the entrepreneurial project proposal. The focus was on formulating concrete hypotheses regarding the solution's viability, evaluating technologies and sustainable strategies.

Additionally, analyses were carried out to determine the most suitable path for the project, culminating in the selection of the priority hypothesis.

<br>
🛠️ Main Deliverables:
<br>
📝 Initial scope registration of the entrepreneurial project
Structuring the concept of the practical project and defining the foundations for its development.

<br>
💡 Formulation of hypotheses about the product or service
Development of hypotheses on how the solution could be differentiated and innovative within the context of sustainable fashion.

<br>
🧵 Selection of the priority hypothesis
After a comparative analysis, Hypothesis 3.3 – Craftsmanship Assisted by Software and Modeling Processes was chosen as the main proposal for the MVP.
The solution aims to create a system capable of adapting sizes according to body measurements.

<br>
📢 User profile mapping (Postponed to Module 2)
Although it was initiated, the user/consumer profile mapping was, in agreement with the advisor, postponed for further development in the next module.

This strategic decision was made to ensure that the solution definition was properly consolidated before collecting qualitative data.

Starting the user mapping prematurely could generate inconsistencies, given that the project was still in the conceptual consolidation phase.

Therefore, it was decided to defer this step to ensure that the user profile research would be more precise and aligned with the proposed product.

The focus of this sprint, therefore, remained on consolidating the central idea of the project, ensuring a solid foundation for the upcoming research and development phases.

<br>
🎯 Sprint Objective:
<br>
Define the concept of the entrepreneurial project, consolidate the solution hypothesis, and establish a structured foundation for the MVP development, aligning innovation, sustainability, and technological viability.

<br>
Sprint 4
<br>
During Sprint 4, the focus was on deepening the conceptual and practical foundation of the project, aiming to refine insights and structure the first screens and functionalities of the proposed solution.

📢 Although the initial plan involved evaluating sustainable models and environmental impacts, the sprint evolved into a more applied and exploratory path.

This strategic shift occurred because, together with the academic advisor, I identified the need to prioritize practical experimentation and the initial structuring of the proposed solution. It was considered essential to:

Explore empirical knowledge related to manual techniques, strengthening the practical foundation of the MVP;

Test and develop basic artisanal skills, such as crochet, to better understand the challenges and particularities of manual work;

Investigate the technical differentials of software like CLO 3D and Knitting Genius, identifying gaps and opportunities for the technological proposal;

Structure the initial wireframes, visually anticipating the flow and user experience of the solution to be developed.

Thus, evolving into a more practical and exploratory approach was crucial to consolidate practical foundations, align project expectations, and ensure that the proposed solution would be viable, innovative, and effectively aligned with sector demands.

<br>
🛠️ Main Deliverables:
<br>
🧠 Theoretical exploration on empirical knowledge
Study on manual practices and the importance of tacit knowledge in developing sustainable and inclusive solutions.

<br>
🧵 Practical crochet exercises
Hands-on exercises focusing on the repetition of simple stitches to deepen understanding of artisanal processes.

<br>
🎨 Study and evaluation of CLO 3D and Knitting Genius
Investigation into the differentials of 3D modeling software.

<br>
🖥️ Conclusion and development of initial wireframes
Creation of the first screens of the solution, visually representing the main flows and functionalities.

<br>
🔍 Critical analysis of innovation opportunities
Discussion on existing "gaps" in the market and identification of strategic opportunities for the project.

<br>
🎯 Sprint Objective:
<br>
Refine theoretical and practical learnings, structure the first prototypes of the project, and align the proposed solution with real market demands, focusing on innovation, sustainability, and democratization of knowledge.

<br>
Sprint 5
<br>
During Sprint 5, the focus was on consolidating and qualifying the project's documentation, organizing the material produced, and preparing the transition to the next modules.
