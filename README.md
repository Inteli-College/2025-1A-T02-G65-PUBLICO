# 📚 Module 1 – Fashion and Sustainability  
<br>

The first module of the project aimed to conduct an in-depth mapping of the challenges, opportunities, and trends in the sustainable fashion sector, with the objective of building a solid foundation for the development of the next phases of the project.  
<br>

An exploratory and investigative approach was adopted, structured around three main axes: research, analysis, and practice.  
<br><br>

## 🚀 Sprint 1 – Problem Exploration and Conceptual Foundation  
<br>

## 🛠️ Main Deliverables:  
<br>

Research of scientific articles, industry reports, and academic studies to theoretically support the project.  
<br>

- 🧩 **Glossary of Key Terms**  
Definition of fundamental concepts (fashion, sustainability, ethics in fashion, among others), ensuring conceptual alignment for the project.  
<br>

- 🌎 **Mapping of Opportunities**  
Analysis of a successful case in sustainable fashion, identifying best practices and potential paths for innovation.  
<br>

- 💡 **Initial Reflection on Possible Solutions**  
Development of initial ideas for innovative approaches based on the analysis of mapped challenges and trends.  
<br>

- 📝 **Planning Documentation**  
Completion of the project plan, meeting forms, and tracking forms, formalizing the record of activities.  
<br>

## 🎯 Sprint Objective:  
<br>

Build the initial conceptual and strategic foundation of the project, providing input for the next stages of deepening and solution development.  
<br><br>

## 🚀 Sprint 2 – Market Research and Strategic Alignment  
<br>

## 🛠️ Main Deliverables:  
<br>

- 📊 **Market Research on Sustainable Fashion**  
Collection of quantitative and qualitative data, trend analysis, and identification of gaps in the sector.  
<br>

- 🌱 **Analysis of the Environmental and Social Impact of the Fashion Industry**  
Mapping of the most critical areas and the main negative impacts throughout the fashion production cycle.  
<br>

- 🎯 **Identification of Strategies to Make Initial Ideas Viable**  
Reflection on strategic approaches to make sustainable fashion more applicable and realistic in the current market context.  
<br>

- 📖 **Complementary Literature Review**  
Continuation of theoretical research with new scientific articles, academic studies, and updated industry reports.  
<br>

- 🧩 **Update of the Glossary of Key Terms**  
Expansion and refinement of the glossary by incorporating new relevant concepts for the project.  
<br>

## 🎯 Sprint Objective:  
<br>

Support the project with strategic information and critical analysis, strengthening the theoretical and market foundation for building innovative and sustainable solutions in the next modules.  
<br><br>

## 🚀 Sprint 3 – Hypotheses Structuring and Solution Definition  
<br>

## 🛠️ Main Deliverables:  
<br>

- 📝 **Initial Scope Registration of the Entrepreneurial Project**  
Structuring the concept of the practical project and defining the foundations for its development.  
<br>

- 💡 **Formulation of Hypotheses about the Product or Service**  
Development of hypotheses on how the solution could be differentiated and innovative within the context of sustainable fashion.  
<br>

- 🧵 **Selection of the Priority Hypothesis**  
After a comparative analysis, **Hypothesis 3.3 – Craftsmanship Assisted by Software and Modeling Processes** was chosen as the main proposal for the MVP.  
The solution aims to create a system capable of adapting sizes according to body measurements.  
<br>

- 📢 **User Profile Mapping (Postponed to Module 2)**  
Although initiated, in agreement with the advisor, the user/consumer profile mapping was postponed for further development in the next module.  

This strategic decision was made to ensure that the solution definition was properly consolidated before collecting qualitative data.  
Starting the user mapping prematurely could generate inconsistencies, given that the project was still in the conceptual consolidation phase.  
Thus, it was decided to defer this step to ensure that the user profile research would be more precise and aligned with the proposed product.  
<br>

## 🎯 Sprint Objective:  
<br>

Define the concept of the entrepreneurial project, consolidate the solution hypothesis, and establish a structured foundation for the MVP development, aligning innovation, sustainability, and technological viability.  
<br><br>

## 🚀 Sprint 4 – Practical Exploration and Wireframe Development  
<br>

## 🛠️ Main Deliverables:  
<br>

- 🧠 **Theoretical Exploration on Empirical Knowledge**  
Study on manual practices and the importance of tacit knowledge in developing sustainable and inclusive solutions.  
<br>

- 🧵 **Practical Crochet Exercises**  
Hands-on exercises focusing on the repetition of simple stitches to deepen understanding of artisanal processes.  
<br>

- 🎨 **Study and Evaluation of CLO 3D and Knitting Genius**  
Investigation into the differentials of 3D modeling software.  
<br>

- 🖥️ **Conclusion and Development of Initial Wireframes**  
Creation of the first screens of the solution, visually representing the main flows and functionalities.  
<br>

- 🔍 **Critical Analysis of Innovation Opportunities**  
Discussion on existing "gaps" in the market and identification of strategic opportunities for the project.  
<br>

## 📢 Strategic Adjustment:  
<br>

Although the initial plan involved evaluating sustainable models and environmental impacts, the sprint evolved into a more applied and exploratory path.  
<br>

This strategic shift occurred because, together with the academic advisor, I identified the need to prioritize practical experimentation and the initial structuring of the proposed solution.  
<br>

It was considered essential to:  
- Explore empirical knowledge related to manual techniques;  
- Test and develop basic artisanal skills, such as crochet;  
- Investigate technical gaps and opportunities using CLO 3D and Knitting Genius;  
- Structure the first visual wireframes of the proposed solution.  
<br>

Thus, this shift ensured that the solution would be more viable, innovative, and aligned with market demands.  
<br>

## 🎯 Sprint Objective:  
<br>

Refine theoretical and practical learnings, structure the first prototypes of the project, and align the proposed solution with real market demands, focusing on innovation, sustainability, and democratization of knowledge.  
<br><br>
