## 📊 Planned vs. Achieved – Module 14

### 🧩 Introduction
Module 14 focused on the planning and conceptual structuring phase of the project, based on a user-centered and practical validation approach. During its execution, the team aimed to align the planned deliverables with the original schedule, but adjustments became necessary as the project evolved and new demands emerged.

This shift occurred mainly because the interviews conducted in Sprint 3 were much more comprehensive than initially planned. As a result, the project expanded, new ideas emerged (“POW” moments), and potential new features were identified. We are still awaiting an interview with a partner company to finalize this discovery cycle.

### 💡 Justification for the Changes
The changes in the timeline and deliverables resulted from an unexpected deepening in the qualitative interviews, which revealed previously unconsidered opportunities. The high engagement of participants and the richness of insights led to an expanded project vision, requiring more time to structure ideas, prioritize functionalities, and adapt the prototype. The validation process with real users and the expectation of collaborating with companies in the sector also justified the rescheduling of phases.

<br><br>

## 🚀 Sprint 3 – Hypotheses Structuring and Solution Definition  
<br>
Sprint 3
During Sprint 3, we moved on to the phase of defining and consolidating the entrepreneurial project proposal. The focus was on formulating concrete hypotheses regarding the solution's viability, evaluating technologies and sustainable strategies.

## 🛠️ Main Deliverables:  
<br>

- 📝 **Initial Scope Registration of the Entrepreneurial Project**  
Structuring the concept of the practical project and defining the foundations for its development.  
<br>

- 💡 **Formulation of Hypotheses about the Product or Service**  
Development of hypotheses on how the solution could be differentiated and innovative within the context of sustainable fashion.  
<br>

- 🧵 **Selection of the Priority Hypothesis**  
After a comparative analysis, **Hypothesis 3.3 – Craftsmanship Assisted by Software and Modeling Processes** was chosen as the main proposal for the MVP.  
The solution aims to create a system capable of adapting sizes according to body measurements.  
<br>

- 📢 **User Profile Mapping (Postponed to Module 2)**  
Although initiated, in agreement with the advisor, the user/consumer profile mapping was postponed for further development in the next module.  

This strategic decision was made to ensure that the solution definition was properly consolidated before collecting qualitative data.  
Starting the user mapping prematurely could generate inconsistencies, given that the project was still in the conceptual consolidation phase.  
Thus, it was decided to defer this step to ensure that the user profile research would be more precise and aligned with the proposed product.  
<br>

## 🎯 Sprint Objective:  
<br>
Define the concept of the entrepreneurial project, consolidate the solution hypothesis, and establish a structured foundation for the MVP development, aligning innovation, sustainability, and technological viability.

<br>
Sprint 4
During Sprint 4, the focus was on deepening the conceptual and practical foundation of the project, aiming to refine insights and structure the first screens and functionalities of the proposed solution.

📢 Although the initial plan involved evaluating sustainable models and environmental impacts, the sprint evolved into a more applied and exploratory path.

This strategic shift occurred because, together with the academic advisor, I identified the need to prioritize practical experimentation and the initial structuring of the proposed solution. It was considered essential to:

Explore empirical knowledge related to manual techniques, strengthening the practical foundation of the MVP;

Test and develop basic artisanal skills, such as crochet, to better understand the challenges and particularities of manual work;

Investigate the technical differentials of software like CLO 3D and Knitting Genius, identifying gaps and opportunities for the technological proposal;

Structure the initial wireframes, visually anticipating the flow and user experience of the solution to be developed.

Thus, evolving into a more practical and exploratory approach was crucial to consolidate practical foundations, align project expectations, and ensure that the proposed solution would be viable, innovative, and effectively aligned with sector demands.

<br>
🛠️ Main Deliverables:
<br>

- 🧠 **Theoretical Exploration on Empirical Knowledge**  
Study on manual practices and the importance of tacit knowledge in developing sustainable and inclusive solutions.  
<br>

- 🧵 **Practical Crochet Exercises**  
Hands-on exercises focusing on the repetition of simple stitches to deepen understanding of artisanal processes.  
<br>

- 🎨 **Study and Evaluation of CLO 3D and Knitting Genius**  
Investigation into the differentials of 3D modeling software.  
<br>

- 🖥️ **Conclusion and Development of Initial Wireframes**  
Creation of the first screens of the solution, visually representing the main flows and functionalities.  
<br>

- 🔍 **Critical Analysis of Innovation Opportunities**  
Discussion on existing "gaps" in the market and identification of strategic opportunities for the project.  
<br>

## 📢 Strategic Adjustment:  
<br>

Although the initial plan involved evaluating sustainable models and environmental impacts, the sprint evolved into a more applied and exploratory path.  
<br>

This strategic shift occurred because, together with the academic advisor, I identified the need to prioritize practical experimentation and the initial structuring of the proposed solution.
