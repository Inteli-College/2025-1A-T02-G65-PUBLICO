# 📊 Module 15  

Module 15 represented the **technical and conceptual consolidation** of my project, aiming to transform the ideas developed in Module 14 into a **functional prototype**, validated and contextualized for the final presentation.  
Throughout the five sprints, I made significant progress in **structuring the front end**, **formalizing the mathematical gauge model**, and **integrating crochet and computing**, culminating in the **pre-defense presentation**.

---

## 🧩 Sprint 1 – Preparation and Project Structuring  

In this sprint, I focused on **configuring the development environment** and defining the **technological stack** that would support the MVP.  
I set up essential dependencies (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ESLint, and Recharts), organized the main folders, and standardized the build and execution scripts.  

**Main Deliverables:**  
- Functional front-end environment  
- Base architecture defined  
- Initial technical documentation  

---

## 🧵 Sprint 2 – User Journey and Initial Prototype  

The focus of this sprint was to **design the initial user journey flow**, creating a three-step form (Body Measurements, Materials, and Project Planning).  
I developed the first **interactive prototype in Figma**, representing the initial version of the user experience, and validated the front-end structure locally.  
During testing, I realized that starting the flow with the measurement step increased user drop-offs, which led me to propose a **new step order**, beginning with **piece definition** instead.  

**Main Deliverables:**  
- Interactive prototype (v0)  
- Validated front-end structure  
- Improved and reorganized user flow  

---

## ⚙️ Sprint 3 – Scope Adjustment and Proof of Concept (PoC)  

In this sprint, the focus was to **validate the mathematical model** for converting body measurements into stitches and rows (gauge).  
Due to technical and infrastructure limitations, I adjusted the scope to develop a **simplified Proof of Concept (PoC)** that demonstrated the feasibility of the **Point Map**, automatically generated through JavaScript.  
This stage confirmed the consistency of the calculations and served as a foundation for future integration with the complete front end.  

**Main Deliverables:**  
- Functional PoC of the Point Map  
- Mathematical model validated  
- Technical documentation updated  

---

## 📐 Sprint 4 – Gauge Model Formalization and CYC Classification  

The focus of Sprint 4 was to consolidate the **theoretical and technical foundations** of the project.  
I documented the principles of the **gauge model**, the **conversion formulas**, and the **CYC (Craft Yarn Council) classification** — an international standard that defines yarn thickness, hook sizes, and average stitch densities.  
This formalization added **scientific robustness** to the project and established universal parameters for the automatic calculation of the point map.  

**Main Deliverables:**  
- Documentation of the gauge model and CYC table  
- Experimental calibration with 10×10 cm sample  
- Consolidated mathematical model  

---

## 💻 Sprint 5 – Pre-Defense and Conceptual Consolidation  

In this sprint, I focused on **preparing and delivering the pre-defense presentation**.  
This stage served as a **conceptual validation milestone**, reinforcing the coherence between the identified problem, the proposed solution, and the target audience.  
I aimed to build a narrative that connected **crochet and computing**, referencing **Ada Lovelace** and the **Jacquard looms**, strengthening the conceptual and historical context of the project.  

In parallel, I developed the **functional map in Figma**, based on the previously implemented gauge model.  
Despite significant progress, **some technical errors in the point map** prevented me from completing the **official usability and accuracy tests** within the module’s timeframe.  
Additionally, preparing for the pre-defense required **visual and conceptual refinements**, which reduced the available time for full testing.  

However, these tests are **already planned for Module 16**, where they will be conducted in a controlled environment to **empirically validate the map generation model** and analyze its performance.  

**Main Deliverables:**  
- Updated prototype in Figma (functional map)  
- Pre-defense presentation completed  
- Feedback incorporated for final adjustments  

---

## 🧶 Module 15 Synthesis  

Module 15 marked the **maturation of the project**, integrating technical, mathematical, and conceptual foundations.  
With a validated digital base and a consolidated theoretical model, the project now moves toward the **formal testing phase and final defense**, which will take place in Module 16 — completing the cycle between **theory, prototyping, and practical validation**.


























## 📊 Planned vs. Achieved – Module 14

### 🧩 Introduction
Module 14 focused on the planning and conceptual structuring phase of the project, based on a user-centered and practical validation approach. During its execution, the team aimed to align the planned deliverables with the original schedule, but adjustments became necessary as the project evolved and new demands emerged.

This shift occurred mainly because the interviews conducted in Sprint 3 were much more comprehensive than initially planned. As a result, the project expanded, new ideas emerged (“POW” moments), and potential new features were identified. We are still awaiting an interview with a partner company to finalize this discovery cycle.

### 💡 Justification for the Changes
The changes in the timeline and deliverables resulted from an unexpected deepening in the qualitative interviews, which revealed previously unconsidered opportunities. The high engagement of participants and the richness of insights led to an expanded project vision, requiring more time to structure ideas, prioritize functionalities, and adapt the prototype. The validation process with real users and the expectation of collaborating with companies in the sector also justified the rescheduling of phases.
